# HISTORY


-- [[ asanetory.api had been a project launched in Feb 22 . 2024, but had been 
cancelled temporarily due to the business of other projects. ]]

-- Today, asanetory is back and better, with more time to commit into the project.

-- [[ Our purpose is to be externally functional, currently. We dont
have a specific purpose yet, as our project had just relaunched as of August 16, 2025. ]]

--[[ Seeking support as of now, asanetory is a one-person project, being made by somebody with
little experience but extra hope. ]]
